Where recent share prices (the 12-day averages) are higher than longer-term prices (the 26-day averages), the MACD value will be positive. That suggests upward momentum in the market.

A reading of zero in this indicator shows that every day's closing price change has been negative during the covered period. A reading of 100 shows that every price change has been positive in that period, and a reading of 50 indicates that the ups and downs cancelled each other out."
