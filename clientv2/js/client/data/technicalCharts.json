When viewed over time (as in our graphs), the 15-day SMA suggests the shapes of short-term trading trends and the 50-day, medium-term trends."

When it starts to fall consistently, it eventually falls below its SMA. Being above the SMA is generally seen as a bullish signal; below, a bearish signal."

Where recent share prices (the 12-day averages) are higher than longer-term prices (the 26-day averages), the MACD value will be positive. That suggests upward momentum in the market. Where recent prices are lower, the MACD turns negative. That suggests that momentum may have shifted."

The columns of the histogram extend above or below zero. The longer the column at any point, the greater the momentum in that direction. Positive numbers are generally considered bullish, and negative, bearish."

The MACD signal line shows how quickly the MACD itself is changing, and in which direction. When the MACD line crosses the MACD signal line on an upswing, it creates a bullish signal and on a downswing, a bearish signal."

A reading of zero in this indicator shows that every day's closing price change has been negative during the covered period. A reading of 100 shows that every price change has been positive in that period, and a reading of 50 indicates that the ups and downs cancelled each other out."

Readings above 70 suggest strong upward momentum and the possibility a stock has become too highly valued for the current market, a condition called overbought. Readings below 25 may be the result of strong downward momentum, which could have depressed the value of the stock excessively. That condition is called oversold."
